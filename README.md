# Frectal Trees

A "binary fractal tree" is defined recursively by symmetric binary branching. The trunk of length 1 splits into two branches of length r, each making an angle q with the direction of the trunk. Both of these branches divides into two branches of length r/2, each making an angle q with the direction of its parent branch. Continuing in this way for infinitely many branchings, the tree is the set of branches, together with their limit points, called "branch tips".
